# **About Quinoa**

### Quinoa is hobby project developed by [Casey Allen](https://github.com/CaseyAllen)
### It is a programming language inspired heavily by Rust



# Syntax

## Modules

### Quinoa code revolves around the idea of modules, a module can essentially be thought of as a namespace.
### Modules may have various members such as Methods, Properties, and Types.
### Modules may explicitly implement specific behaviors via the `is` keyword

## Methods

### Quinoa methods 

<!-- ## Instance Methods?

### Quinoa does not allow struct methods in the traditional sense, instead the compiler will attempt to find a method within the module, who's first parameter is of type `struct&`. This enforces a subtle separation between Data and Methods -->
